<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>

* Create a terminal based game in java
* Game must take input from the player
* Game must provide output to the player so they know how they're doing and what to do next
* Code must adhere to the 4 pillars of OOP
* Each entity must have its own class
* Code must Implement at least 1 Interface, 1 Abstract class, 1 lambda expression, and 1 stream
* Code must have an organized and logical project structure with at least 1 package
* Code must have some type of error handling for bad user input
* To get bonus points: the code must incorporate at least 2 SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design 
* To get bonus points: the code must incorporate at least 2 Object Oriented Design Patterns
* To get bonus points: Create and host a landing page to showcase the features, functionality, and instructions for how to play the game
* To get bonus points: develop a front-end UI for the game

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

* Completed OOP.md
* Decide on a name for the game
* Create characters to be the player's companions in each game area
* Create class diagrams for game
* Write out overarching storylines for each game area
* Write introductory interactions for all NPCs
* Write storylines for each day played in each game area
* Create a logo
* Create images of each NPC
* Create landing page for game

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>

* Game name- Terminal Fascination
* NPC Companions:
    - Princess Jessica (Natural loving human)
    - Adametes (Warrior half-bear half-human Centaur)
    - Gabel (Dangerous Bandit)
    - Criteon (Mysterious shapeshifter)
* NPC personalities written (Will add here later to avoid spoilers)
* Game areas created:
    - Royal Court - Home of Princess Jessica, overrun with the Kingdom's enemies
    - Woods - Home of Adametes, crawling with enemies on their way to the Royal Court
    - Abandoned Castle - Home of cast out Lord of the land, now full of bandits looting the previous Lord's treasure
    - Underground Tunnels - Tunnels running under most of the Kingdom, almost completely forgotten, enemies have just discovered a way in through the Royal Court
    - Tavern - a location the player will only be allowed to visit once, that introduces them to all the NPCs
* Class diagram created (assets/class-diagram.png)
* Completed OOP.md
* Wrote storyline for Tavern level
* Wrote storylines for Underground Tunnel levels
* Created game logo
* Wrote instructions and added them to Game-Instructions.md and the game website
* Created game website
* Wrote all levels for Abandoned Castle
* Added comments marking requirements and bonuses in the code

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>

* Likely should have planned for fewer levels, but I wanted to get a full story across
* Had issues getting the code to work when the levels were all their own class, maybe could have made it work with more time, not sure if it was the better way to create each level though
* With more time, I'd like to get the paragraphs laid out in a way that is pleasing to look at, the current wrap will wrap anywhere in a word and not add a dash, so it can be harder to read. Maybe a GUI is needed.
* Will continue this project until all levels are finished, and the "alpha build" is available.
* Would like to add character art to the website once I have Adobe Illustrator again
* Presentation took slightly longer than was allotted, should have set an exact plan of the levels I'd run through
